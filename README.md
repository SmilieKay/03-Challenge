# 03-Challenge Password Generator 
## Expected Outcome

To make a password generator the provides a series or prompts. The prompts determine the length  between 8 and 128 characters and if the user wants special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letter, and numbers. Based on the selections of the user a password is generated. 

## Actual Behavior 
The styling in css and html was already provided so the main objective was to create the JavaScript for the pass code generator to work. 
This was especially challenging for me and took a lot of research to finally get it to work correctly.
